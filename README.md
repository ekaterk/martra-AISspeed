# martra-AISspeed
This repository documents the development of the tree-based machine learning model for vessel speed prediction in icy waters.
It contains model_implementation and model_precition notebooks; the XGBoost model with weights (models/pima.pickle.dat), and synthetic datasets that can be used for model testing. 
For details about the model and its use cases refer to the work by Rao P.S., Kim, E., Smestad, B.B, Asbjørnslett, B.E, and Bhattacharyya, A., “Predicting vessel speed in the Arctic without knowing ice conditions using AIS data and decision trees”, Maritime Transport Research, 2, 2021.
